Cluster Architecture
====================

Philosophy
----------

The Faros reference architecture is specifically designed to support far edge
environments. For this reason: things like minimal power draw, minimal heat
production, and minimal footprint take priority to concerns like high
availability. This architecture is not the best solution for a data center,
but is appropriate for use cases like remote branch offices, remotely
deployable computing, IoT gateways, and far edge.
